      "description": "Accidents will happen, spills will occur. In some oil producing zones operators can be identified and respond to a spill quickly. However, in many parts of the world they are not so well identified. The WFCRC’s “Best Practices” plan not only makes current information about spill cleanup available, it is an on-going effort to collect data about cleanups. WFCRC aims to get this important, and continually refined, information into the hands of people that need it the most: coastal constituents and developing island nations.\n\nFrom containing a spill with booms, to using hay to soak up oil, to spreading dispersants to help dilute a spill, there are many different ways to respond to an oil or chemical spill. Different kinds of spills in different parts of the world require specialized cleanup, whether due to volume, cooperation of parties responsible, or simple availability of cleanup materials.",
